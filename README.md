A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation
 Clone the project and run 
 ```bash
 composer install
 ```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

Visit app_local.php file and configure your database.
I have configured the database with my local database i.e graphiclead

If you download the project and you will see database_schema folder, Inside the folder you will see,
graphiclead.sql file.
Import the sql file.

Also please import postman collection file inside postman_collection folder.

Pending work
1. Code refactoring
2. Use same response format throughout the project
3. Added few more validation
4. Configure swagger properly



To access swagger, please vist `http://localhost:8765/swagger`



## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
